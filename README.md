# Image Search Engine
Replace the path to your dataset in the code with the path of your chosen dataset filled with images you have chosen. Uses ResNet-50 to transform the chosen image dataset into embeddings. In the terminal, enter in the base64 representation of the image you have chosen, and the closest 5 images' filenames from the dataset that are similar to your image should appear.
